### Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Make**
   - Converted all entries to lowercase for consistency.

2. **Model**
   - Converted all entries to lowercase for consistency.

3. **Make Model Trim**
   - Created a new column that combines `make`, `model`, and `trim` into a single string.

4. **Type**
   - Converted all entries to lowercase.
   - Standardized the values to categories: `sedan`, `suv`, `hatchback`, `minivan`, `coupe`, `wagon`, `convertible`, `truck` (including everything with "cab").

5. **Transmission**
   - Dropped the single entry labeled as "Sedan".

6. **States**
   - Dropped the entry with a nonsensical state value.

7. **Color**
   - Dropped the entry with the color value "16633".

8. **Interior**
   - No changes made.

9. **Odometer**
   - No changes made.

10. **Seller**
    - No changes made.

11. **MMR**
    - No changes made.
